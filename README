Readme file for generalized BCH code performance evaluator.
By generalized the following is meant:
	Codes over GF(Q^s) can be evaluated for performance.
	Q is any prime or its power.
	s belongs to Natural number set viz. 1,2,3,..

Read the global.h file before modification.

The DIM parameter in global.h controls the dimension of the modulation. A 64  symbol code may thus be sent by splitting into two 8-symbol modulation scheme.

Executable file naming convention.
GGGaaSbbTcc.e

GGG- BCH or RS.
aa is replaced by the numerical value of Q.
bb is replaced by the numerical value of S.
cc is replaced by the numerical value of T.
e  = out, when executable = dat, when data file.

Pecularities about the mapping/ constellation used for modulation must be mentioned in the main.c file as well as the figure generated from the dat file.

Thus:
BCHQ8S2T2.out - Double error correcting BCH code of over GF(8^2). This is the executable file.
Note: AWGN channel is the one over which performance evaluation is done.
